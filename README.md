# Smart Cab Allocation System - MoveInSync

## Overview
This project implements a Smart Cab Allocation System using the MERN stack. The system features robust user authentication, a cab allocation algorithm based on Dijkstra's algorithm using Breadth-First Search (BFS), and real-time location tracking within a 50x50 grid city layout.

## Tech-Stack Used

## Algorithm
- **Cab Allocation Algorithm:** Implemented using Dijkstra's algorithm with BFS for shortest path calculation.
- **Grid Layout:** The city is represented as a 50x50 grid, where each cell is a node.

## Assumption
The city is modeled as a grid with each location represented by x and y coordinates. Cabs move only on roads connecting points in four directions: left, right, bottom, and top. All cabs move at the same speed, covering one unit in any direction per minute.

## Features
- Robust User Authentication
- Real-Time Location Tracking
- Cab Allocation Optimization
- Employee Cab Search Optimization

## Conclusion
The Smart Cab Allocation System effectively addresses the problem statement through efficient algorithms, real-time data integration, and comprehensive error handling. The system ensures high performance, scalability, and user satisfaction.
